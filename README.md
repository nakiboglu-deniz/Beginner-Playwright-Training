# Playwright with Python — Beginner Test Automation Training

This is a hands-on training program covering Python fundamentals, UI automation, API testing with Playwright using AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot.

## 📋 Overview

Beginner Self-Study Training Program  ** Organizatory curriculum **

This training is designed as a beginner self-study program. Participants will follow the instructions provided in the README.md file, clone the repository, and complete the required exercises independently.
To support the learning process, participants can refer to the videos linked within the README.md documentation. The expected duration of the training is up to 40 hours. However, if additional time is needed, participants may continue at a reasonable pace until they complete all requirements.

For questions or support during the training, a dedicated Microsoft Teams group will be available. Participants can post their questions there, and the trainers will respond as their availability permits.
Upon completing the training, participants must review their solutions using the AI agent provided in the .github folder. Instructions for running and using the agent are available in the README.md file. The resulting output should then be shared in the Microsoft Teams group for review and feedback.

### Part 1: Python Fundamentals and Playwright UI Testing

Part 1 introduces the Python knowledge required for test automation and then applies it to browser-based testing with Playwright.

You will learn:

- Python syntax, variables, data types, operators, and type casting
- Control flow, loops, functions, variable scope, and error handling
- Playwright browser, browser context, and page concepts
- Navigation, locators, interactions, synchronization, and assertions
- Page Object Model design
- Screenshots and HTML test reports

### Part 2: Playwright API Testing and AI-Assisted Automation

Part 2 focuses on REST API testing with Playwright's `APIRequestContext` and introduces GitHub Copilot and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent-assisted test creation, execution, and debugging.

You will learn:

- REST API concepts, endpoints, request methods, headers, parameters, and bodies
- GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
- Response status, headers, and JSON body validation
- Negative testing and unsuccessful requests
- API test refactoring and reusable base URLs
- GitHub Copilot and MCP concepts
- Using an AI agent to explore an application, generate tests, run them, and fix failures

**************************************************************************************************************************
This project demonstrates advanced test automation using:

- **Playwright for Python** for UI/Web and API testing
- **pytest** as the testing framework
- **pytest-playwright** for Playwright fixtures and browser management
- **Allure** for test reporting
- **pytest-xdist** for parallel test execution

The training targets a real, live application: [testauto.app/task-manager-spa](https://testauto.app/task-manager-spa)

## 🧪 Example Tests

### UI Testing (Playwright)
The smoke test in `src/tests/smoke_test.py` demonstrates basic navigation, element visibility, and API health checks.

### API Testing (Playwright APIRequestContext)
The `api_v1` and `api_v2` fixtures in `src/conftest.py` provide pre-configured request contexts — one unauthenticated, one pre-logged-in with JWT.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- Page object code goes in `src/pages/` — locators and actions only
- Test code goes in `src/tests/` — test functions, no raw selectors
- Shared fixtures go in `src/conftest.py`
- Every test that creates API data **must clean it up** — use `try/finally`
- Use `uuid` to generate unique task titles — prevents cross-test interference
- Prefer `get_by_role`, `get_by_label`, `get_by_placeholder` over CSS selectors
- Use `expect()` for assertions — it retries automatically

---

## 🔧 Configuration
